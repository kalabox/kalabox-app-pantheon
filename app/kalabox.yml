#
# Kalabox Pantheon app configuration file
#
# This file contains the top level configuration for your Pantheon app
# and for the plugins it contains. See inline below for more detail
# on each.
#

#
# This is the name you choose during `kbox create pantheon`. Changing this
# is generally dark and full of peril.
#
name: pantheon

#
# This tells Kalabox that this is a Pantheon app. Generally you are not
# going to want to edit or change this either
#
type: pantheon

#
# This is an array of the plugins that a Kalabox app implements. By default
# Kalabox will look for plugins in the current directories:
#
#   Inside of Kalabox source/binary
#
#     1. ./node_modules/*
#     2. ./plugins
#
#   Relative to the root of your app directory
#
#     1. ./node_modules/*
#     2. ./plugins/*
#
#   In the global plugin directory
#
#     1. ~/.kalabox/plugins
#
# Drop a plugin in one of these locations and then add it to the plugins array
# below. Example:
#
#   plugins:
#     - kalabox-plugin-pantheon
#     - my-wicked-awesome-plugin
#
plugins:
  - kalabox-plugin-pantheon

#
# This contains configuration for each plugin that Kalabox uses for a Pantheon
# app. "cli", "sharing" and "services" are all core Kalabox plugins.
#
# Read more inline below for options on each.
#
# It is also worth noting that changing these options may cause your Pantheon
# app to misbehave.
#
pluginconfig:

  #
  # cli plugin config.
  #
  # The cli plugin allows users to specify which tooling
  # options they want available for their app. This is a great way to get
  # your team using the exact same tools that make the most sense for this
  # app.
  #
  # Options:
  #   cli: [on|off] - Turns the Kalabox cli plugin on or off for this app.
  #
  # The cli plugin will also install the services in the kalabox-cli.yml file
  # and also load tasks that live in the cli.yml file. Check out both
  # those files for more options.
  #
  cli: on

  #
  # sharing plugin config.
  #
  # The sharing plugin shares your apps code between the Kalabox VM and
  # your host. Generally you are going to want this on.
  #
  # Options:
  #
  #   share: [service:directory] - Tells Kalabox what service and directory
  #     to share. Generally you will want this to be your webroot
  #
  #   codeDir: [path relative to appRoot] - If you want your code to live on
  #     your host in a different directory than 'code' you can specify that here
  #
  #   ignore: [array of paths] - These are paths that sharing will ignore.
  #     Generally you will not want to share massive amounts of static assets.
  #
  sharing:
    share: data:/code
    ignore:
      - "!*modules*"
      - "sites/default/files"
      - "files"
      - "wp-content/uploads"

  #
  # services plugin config.
  #
  # The services plugin provides domain resolution and proxying for specific
  # services. This will use the global config "domain" key as the DNS suffix.
  # By default this is 'kbox'.
  #
  # Options:
  #   Objects keyed by service name containing a list of proxy objects.
  #
  #   Proxy Object:
  #     - port: [port/protocal] - The exposed service port and protocol
  #     - hostname: [string] - the hostname in HOSTNAME.appname.domain
  #     - default: [true|false] - will use appname.domain as the hostname
  #     - secure: [true|false] - http vs https.
  #
  services:
    appserver:
      - port: 8888/tcp
        default: true
      - port: 444/tcp
        default: true
        secure: true
    edge:
      - port: 80/tcp
        hostname: edge
      - port: 443/tcp
        hostname: edge
        secure: true
